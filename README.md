Classifying MNIST digits using Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
================================================================================

In this project, I have used TensorFlow to implement a CNN model, because TensorFlow allows us to make the most of the available hardware
with asynchronous computation, but it is possible to implement this model using standared tools like R/Matlab or Other Python libraries 
as well.
